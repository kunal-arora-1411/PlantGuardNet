# 🌿 PlantGuardNet

**PlantGuardNet** is a deep learning-based system for intelligent plant disease detection and care recommendation. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify crop types and detect diseases from leaf images, providing tailored agronomic advice.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📸 Leaf-based disease classification using CNN  
- 🧪 Integration with crop-specific knowledge base (soil, nutrients, pesticides)  
- 🔁 Dynamic recommendation system (soil type, water, fertilizer, pesticide)  
- 💻 Streamlit-based user interface  


## 🧩 Model Checkpoint

You can download the trained PyTorch model (`plant_disease_model.pth`) from the following link:

🔗 [Download Model (.pth)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j7aWUiyAGlVr-LY81f3_FZktCd5zUC-S/view?usp=sharing)

> Place the `.pth` file inside your project directory where the model is loaded.
