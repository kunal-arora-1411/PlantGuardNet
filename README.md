# 🌿 PlantGuardNet

**PlantGuardNet** is a deep learning-based system for intelligent plant disease detection and care recommendation. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify crop types and detect diseases from leaf images, providing tailored agronomic advice.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📸 Leaf-based disease classification using CNN  
- 🧪 Integration with crop-specific knowledge base (soil, nutrients, pesticides)  
- 🔁 Dynamic recommendation system (soil type, water, fertilizer, pesticide)  
- 💻 Streamlit-based user interface


---

## 📂 Dataset

The model was trained on the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease), which contains over 50,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased crop leaves across various plant species like tomato, potato, and pepper.

- ✅ Real-world agricultural conditions
- 🌱 Multi-class disease labeling
- 🧼 Cleaned, augmented, and resized to 256×256 for training
